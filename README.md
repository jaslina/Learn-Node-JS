# Node-JS

Tools needed  : CLI (can use windows powershell in windows)

## V8 Javascript Engine
### processors,machine code, c++

Microprocessor :  It is a tiny machine which takes electrical inputs and perfor a job.
                  We gives instructions to processor 
                  It has a languages like : IA 32, MIPS, ARM
                  
Machine Language (Code) : Programming language spoken by processsors. Every program we run compiled to into machine code.

Level of abstraction in modern development : Javascript -> C/C++ ->Assembly Language -> Machine Code

Node is written in C++ because v8 ( the javascript engine which converts the js code to machine code) is written in C++.

ECMAScript : Standard js is based on ( Needed a standard bcs there are many engines)

Javascript Engine: Pgm that convert js into something the processor can understand. It should follow the ECMAScript std on how the language 
should work and what features it should have.

### V8
1.  Googles open source Javascript Engine
2. Implements ECMAScript
3. written in C++ and used in Google chrome browser
4. v8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any c++ application

javascript ->v8(c++) -> Machine Code
javascript -> My C++ pgm (v8 C++ embedded) -> MAchine code
